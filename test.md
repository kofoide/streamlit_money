# I have a DB2 database that has 500 tables in it. I need to be able to run reports against those tables. Some of these reports can be time critical in nature, meaning I need to see all the latest information that is in the database. I don't want to run these reports directly against the production DB2 database because they will cause too much load on that system. What is the easiest and cheapest way to have access to all this data from another location?

## Goal: Offload Reporting from Production DB2 (500 Tables)

You want:
- Near real-time data for time-sensitive reports  
- No load on the production DB2 system  
- A low-cost, maintainable solution

---

## Recommended Architecture

### ‚úÖ **Use Debezium CDC + Kafka + OLAP Store**

**Overview:**  
Use **Debezium CDC** to extract changes from the DB2 production system, stream them through **Kafka**, and land the data in a **low-cost, analytical database** (e.g., **PostgreSQL**, **ClickHouse**, or **DuckDB**, depending on workload).

---

### üîß Components

#### 1. **Debezium DB2 Connector**  
- Captures **row-level changes** in all 500 tables  
- Sends changes as Kafka events  
- Requires access to DB2 **transaction logs** and **primary keys** on all tables  
- Use **initial snapshot mode** for initial full load  

#### 2. **Apache Kafka (or Redpanda for lightweight deployment)**  
- Streams events from Debezium  
- Durable, scalable, decouples CDC from consumers  
- Redpanda = drop-in Kafka replacement with **lower ops cost**

#### 3. **Sink Connector ‚Üí Analytical Store**  
Choose one of:

| Option       | Pros                                 | Cons                              |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **PostgreSQL** | Familiar, easy reporting (BI tools)  | Not ideal for huge volumes         |
| **ClickHouse** | Fast columnar store, great for reports | Needs schema tuning, no updates    |
| **DuckDB**     | Embedded, local, fast for light use   | No CDC streaming support natively  |

Use **Kafka Connect Sink** (e.g., JDBC sink) to push changes to your reporting DB.

---

### ‚úÖ Result

- **Always-up-to-date** copy of all 500 tables in a separate system
- Reports query the **replica**, not prod DB2
- Entire pipeline is **streaming and scalable**
- Costs limited to:
  - One lightweight Kafka Connect/Debezium node
  - Storage/compute for your target OLAP DB
  - No licensing costs if using OSS stack

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Alternatives (with trade-offs)

| Option                        | Why You Might Consider | Trade-offs                          |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Fivetran / Hevo / Airbyte** | Easy setup             | $$$ and not as real-time (lag)     |
| **IBM InfoSphere CDC**        | Native to DB2          | Expensive, high ops complexity     |
| **Periodic SQL dumps**        | Super cheap            | High latency, brittle, no CDC      |

---

## Final Advice

If cost and flexibility are top concerns, do this:

- Deploy **Debezium + Redpanda (or Kafka)** on a single VM or Docker
- Stream data into **PostgreSQL** (for BI-friendly queries)
- Use **Metabase**, **Redash**, or **Superset** for reports

# Could I do all of this using Microsoft Fabric to pull from the DB2 source?

## Microsoft Fabric with IBM DB2: Viable, But Not Ideal for CDC at Scale

### ‚úÖ **You *can* use Microsoft Fabric** to pull data from a **DB2 source**, but **there are limitations**, especially for **near real-time, large-scale CDC** across 500 tables.

---

## What Fabric Offers

Microsoft Fabric uses **Dataflows Gen2**, **Pipelines**, and **Data Factory connectors** to ingest data. For DB2:

- **IBM DB2 is supported as a source** in **Dataflows** and **Pipelines**
- You can do **batch ingestion** or **scheduled incremental loads** (if configured properly)
- Fabric lands the data in a **Lakehouse (Delta table)**, **Warehouse**, or **KQL DB**

---

## Limitations for Your Use Case

| Limitation                        | Impact to You                                  |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| ‚ùå No native CDC via transaction logs | You can‚Äôt stream changes like Debezium does   |
| ‚ùå No out-of-the-box schema drift handling | Hard to scale across 500+ tables            |
| ‚úÖ Incremental loads possible via timestamp column | Requires every table to have such columns |
| ‚ùå Cost scales with Fabric compute usage | You pay per capacity, can get expensive      |
| ‚úÖ Tight Power BI integration | Great for visualization                        |

---

## Recommendation

### **Only use Microsoft Fabric if:**

- You're okay with **periodic batch loads** (e.g., every 5‚Äì15 minutes)
- Your **tables have a reliable "last updated" column** for incremental load
- You want **tight integration with Power BI**
- You can **tolerate slight lag** and don‚Äôt need event-level fidelity

Otherwise:

> Use **Debezium + Kafka + OLAP DB** for real-time, full-fidelity replication of 500 tables.

---

## Hybrid Option (if Fabric is a must)

- Use **Debezium ‚Üí Kafka ‚Üí Azure Event Hubs (Kafka API)**
- Then use **Microsoft Fabric's Eventstream** to consume from Event Hubs
- Land data into **Lakehouse or Warehouse**

That gives you **true CDC into Fabric**, but it‚Äôs a more complex setup.

---

Want me to diagram both the basic and hybrid Fabric pipelines?


# Do I have to individually setup something for each table on its own? Or is there some part of this that I just tell it which tables I want and it will do the work.

## Table Setup: Manual vs. Automatic Options

### For **Debezium**  
You must **declare each table** you want to capture, but you can do this **in bulk** via configuration. No need to manually create 500 connector configs.

**How to scale it:**
- Use a **regex pattern** in the Debezium connector config:  
  ```json
  "table.include.list": "schema1\\..*,schema2\\.table_*"
  ```
- Or script generation of config via a **template + table list**  
- Debezium will auto-bootstrap and snapshot each table listed

**You must ensure:**
- All tables have **primary keys**
- CDC is **enabled on DB2** for those tables

---

### For **Microsoft Fabric (Dataflows or Pipelines)**  
There is **no out-of-the-box ‚Äúbulk add all tables‚Äù**. You will likely have to:

- Select each table manually in the GUI  
  (or)
- Use **Data Factory pipelines** via ARM templates / JSON configs for automation (tedious)

Fabric does not yet have **table discovery + dynamic ingestion at scale** like Debezium does.

---

## Conclusion

| Tool          | Bulk Table Ingestion | Automation-friendly | Best for 500+ tables |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Debezium**  | ‚úÖ via regex/configs  | ‚úÖ easily scripted     | ‚úÖ                    |
| **Fabric**    | ‚ùå manual or scripted | ‚ö†Ô∏è tedious             | ‚ùå                    |

Use **Debezium** if you want a **set-it-and-scale-it** approach. Want a script to generate the full connector config for 500 tables from a DB2 schema?


# If I use Debezium to perform the CDC against the source and I still want to get the data into a Microsoft Fabric data storage of some sort, how do I do this?

## Debezium ‚Üí Microsoft Fabric: How to Integrate

To feed **Debezium CDC data into Microsoft Fabric**, the best path is via **Azure Event Hubs** and **Fabric Eventstream**, which can receive Kafka-style messages and land them into a **Lakehouse or Warehouse**.

---

## üîÅ Architecture Flow

```plaintext
[DB2] 
  ‚¨á
Debezium (Kafka Connect)
  ‚¨á
Kafka (or Redpanda)
  ‚¨á
Azure Event Hubs (Kafka-compatible endpoint)
  ‚¨á
Microsoft Fabric Eventstream
  ‚¨á
Lakehouse / Warehouse / KQL DB
```

---

## üîß Step-by-Step

### 1. **Set up Debezium**
- Deploy Debezium + Kafka Connect
- Configure the DB2 connector
- Output data into Kafka topics (JSON/AVRO)

### 2. **Connect Kafka to Azure Event Hubs**
- Use **Kafka Connect sink connector** to push data to Event Hubs  
- Event Hubs supports **Kafka protocol** ‚Äî no bridge or translation needed
  - Point your Kafka producer at `your-namespace.servicebus.windows.net:9093`
  - Use SAS key-based authentication

### 3. **Ingest into Microsoft Fabric**
- Create a **Fabric Eventstream** in Data Factory (or directly in Fabric)
- Set Eventstream to consume from **Azure Event Hubs**
- Define **input schema** (auto-detected or manually mapped)
- Route into:
  - **OneLake Lakehouse** (Delta table)
  - **Fabric Warehouse**
  - **KQL DB** for real-time analytics

---

## üî• Key Benefits

- True **streaming CDC into Microsoft Fabric**
- Keeps your reporting layer **fresh with minimal lag**
- Fabric tools like **Power BI** or **Notebooks** can directly consume data

---

## üß† Optional Enhancements

- Add **Stream Analytics** between Event Hubs and Fabric to:
  - Filter/reformat events
  - Handle schema evolution
- Use **Kafka topic partitioning** per table for parallelism

---

# If I choose to Fabric Event Stream, do I have to manually create each stream for each of the 500 tables?

## Fabric Eventstream: Does *Not* Scale Natively for 500 Tables

### ‚ùå **No, Microsoft Fabric Eventstream does not automatically create streams per table.**

But also:  
### ‚ùå **You cannot ingest 500 distinct tables automatically without doing some manual or scripted work.**

---

## How Eventstream Handles Kafka/Hub Input

- **Eventstream sees everything as raw events**, not tables.
- It **does not auto-split or auto-route per topic**.
- For **each Kafka topic** (usually 1 per table in Debezium), you must:
  - Create an **input** mapping for that topic
  - Define the **output sink** (Lakehouse table, KQL table, etc.)
  - Optionally define **transforms** to shape the data (e.g., flatten Debezium‚Äôs envelope)

---

## üîÅ What You‚Äôll Have to Do

### Option A: **Manual Setup**  
- Painfully map each topic ‚Üí output table  
- Define schema mapping/transformation 500x

### Option B: **Scripted Deployment (recommended)**  
Use **ARM/Bicep/REST API/PowerShell** to deploy Eventstream resources programmatically.

Fabric Eventstream is **built on Azure Data Explorer (Kusto)**, so you can:

- Script **input/topic registrations**
- Script **stream-to-table routing rules**
- Dynamically **generate transformation logic** for each table

---

## Better Pattern for Scale

### Use **Stream Analytics** (or custom Kafka consumer) in between:

```plaintext
Debezium (Kafka topics)
  ‚¨á
Azure Event Hubs (Kafka interface)
  ‚¨á
Azure Stream Analytics job
  ‚¨á
Fan out to Fabric Lakehouse tables
```

- Stream Analytics lets you **read multiple topics**
- Parse Debezium JSON envelope
- Route based on topic name dynamically
- Output to **many Lakehouse tables**

---

## Summary

| Strategy                        | Scalable? | Recommended for 500 tables? |
|---------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| Manual Fabric Eventstream setup | ‚ùå        | ‚ùå                           |
| ARM/Bicep scripting             | ‚ö†Ô∏è        | üü° (complex, possible)        |
| Stream Analytics intermediate   | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ (best option)              |

# How complicated is it to manage the operations of all this?

## Operational Complexity: Debezium + Kafka + Event Hubs + Fabric

You‚Äôre looking at a **medium-to-high complexity system**, but it‚Äôs very manageable with the right tooling and automation. Here's a breakdown of what you‚Äôll need to monitor and maintain, and how much effort each area demands.

                                                                 - Retention settings  
                                                                 - TLS/SASL config if using Event Hubs |
| **Azure Event Hubs**             | üü¢ Low          | - Monitor ingress/egress  
                                                                 - Handle scaling based on throughput units |

                                                                 - Maintain routing rules  
                                                                 - Manage storage growth & permissions |

---

## üîÅ Ongoing Maintenance Tasks

### Weekly:
- Check for **stuck connectors or lag** (Debezium offset lag, Kafka consumer lag)
- Validate Eventstream is routing all expected tables
- Inspect Stream Analytics job performance and scaling

### Monthly:
- Audit topic/table coverage (new tables added in DB2)
- Refresh schemas if tables evolved (add columns, type changes)
- Review Azure Event Hubs quotas (throughput units)

### Quarterly:
- Upgrade Debezium/Kafka Connect version
- Review lakehouse/table partitioning and compaction

## üö® What Can Go Wrong?

| Failure Mode                         | How to Handle                                                   |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Schema evolution (added columns)    | Use Debezium‚Äôs `schema.history.kafka.topic` to track changes    |
| Debezium crashes / restarts         | Auto-restart with systemd or Docker, or run in Kubernetes       |
| Event Hub throttling                | Monitor throughput units, scale when needed                     |
| Lakehouse tables drift from source  | Automate schema sync or validate with metadata audits           |

---

## üîß Tooling to Make This Easier

- **Prometheus + Grafana** for metrics (Kafka, Debezium lag, etc.)
- **Kafka Manager or Redpanda Console** for visibility
- **Azure Monitor** for Event Hubs + Stream Analytics
- **Scripted provisioning** (Terraform, Pulumi, or Bicep) for repeatable deploys

---

## Final Verdict

| Operational Category  | Rating |
|-----------------------|--------|
| Setup Time            | üü° Medium (~1‚Äì2 weeks for full pipeline)  
| Day-to-Day Ops        | üü¢ Light with automation  
| Scaling to 500 Tables | ‚úÖ Excellent with scripted config  
| Cost Control          | ‚úÖ Good (only Event Hubs has variable cost)

This setup is **very maintainable** for a single engineer or small data team *if* you automate provisioning, schema monitoring, and observability. Want a checklist or IaC scaffolding to spin it all up?
